# About
----
This repo contains all the projects done in the nanodegree. Each project has its own readme file for details. 

# What to look at
----
For most projects, my write-ups and code can be found in Jupyter Notebook file under each folder. The `report.html` in each project is the export of the notebook. 

For Smartcab project, my version of the code to run the cab is in `agent.py`.
