In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model One: Decision Tree\n",
    "### Real world application\n",
    "Decision tree is mostly used in situations where we're classfying data (although a variation can do numerical data) or want to explain more clearly how the prediction is made. It can be used in many areas such as agriculture, financial services, and physics ([On Growing Better Decision Trees from Data][1]). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strength\n",
    "- Training speed could be fast if the tree is small\n",
    "- Prediction speed is fast and computationally cheap\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and communicate to non-technical people\n",
    "- Can be easily visualized\n",
    "- Non-parametric, and is able to perform non-linear classification\n",
    "- Could take care of outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weakness\n",
    "- Easily get local optima\n",
    "- High variance (random forest helps reduce it by ensembling a lot of dumb trees)\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting. It needs to be pruned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this model\n",
    "- Easy to explain to teachers and can be visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Two: Ensemble Methods (Random Forest)\n",
    "### Real world application\n",
    "Ensemble methods can be used in lots of situations from classification to regression, where we value the prediction performance heavily but less on interpretability. For example, we can use them to predict customer churn rate, classify credit card fraud, or even classify handwritings. Random forest is one of the most commonly used, off-shelve ensemble method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strength\n",
    "- Good in high dimension cases because it only takes a subset of features for each tree\n",
    "- Training speed is comparatively fast because trees are trained in parallel, unlike AdaBoost\n",
    "- Lower variance than single decision tree because of the average/vote of dumb trees\n",
    "- Similar to decision tree, Random Forest can deal with outliers\n",
    "- Feature importance is helpful to find out which features are contributing to the correct predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weakness\n",
    "- Hard to interpret as there are lots of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this\n",
    "- It's an off-shelve and high-performance model that is fast to train and can sometimes perform well even with default parameters\n",
    "- The student data has 31 features, which the teacher may want to know which ones are important\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Three: SVM\n",
    "### Real world application\n",
    "Classification of images, hand-written characters, and proteins etc ([Wiki][2]).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strength\n",
    "- Works well in high dimensions and non-linear space due to the kernel method\n",
    "- Prediction speed is fast because only it only uses a subset of data (aka the support vector)\n",
    "- Robust to outliers because it only maximizes the margin\n",
    "- Maximizing the margin is less likely to overfit\n",
    "- Memory efficient as they only use the support vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weakness\n",
    "- Training speed is slow\n",
    "- Less interpretable than logistic regression or random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this\n",
    "- SVM is a very powerful classification model and can handle non-linear relationship that may appear in the student data. It may be linear, but we don't know.\n",

    "SVM is the best model. It has a low training time and moderately higher prediction time. It has the highest F1 score on test sets and moderately high F1 score on training sets. Both F1 scores on training and test sets are close to each other, which means the model doesn't overfit too much. However, if the data set is large, simple SVM may take much longer time to train. In that case, depending on the resources constraint, we may choose random forest or other more efficient models instead.\n",

    "SVM works in a very intuitive way. Imagine you have a bunch of data points and want to separate them into two groups so that you can tell the class of each data point by refering to the position on the coordinate. Ideally, when the two classes are separated perfectly, there should have a distinctively large space between the cluster of one class and the cluster of another class. SVM is trying to find the way to identify that space, called margin, by using a set of data points that on the boundary of each class cluster to calculate the margin. SVM also works for non-linear space as the kernel could transform data points from low dimension coordinate and plot and separate them in a higher dimension coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does SVM predict when a new data comes in? During the training phase, the model will find the hyperplane which can best separate two clusters of classes. Then during the prediction, the model will find out which space or \"side\" of the hyperplane the new data point falls into. Then it knows which class should be assigned to the new data point."
